This is the first day I create this repository, the reason
is simple -- I want to store my coins and wait for my favorite
stars. Therefore, a computer supervisor is effective.

Good luck to me =)

Today, the initial version is realised. Now this program can
offer simple coin_store operation, but the report format is 
fixed. Here is a template:

-----------------------------
2024/1/13
Coins+=  Coins= 
-----------------------------

Each day you just need to input you new coin number(negative
is ok), and you can know your current total coins.

Okay, that's my first step. Hope I can complete it to a perfect level in the future.
